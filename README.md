# Landing-page


The odin project - Foundations 2nd project.

Probably going to sit on this for now, i did what odin projects askd for but it's too basic. I was thinking this as a knowledge check but turned out to be an unispiring and boring project for me rn.

My main reason to do this Landing page is to learn git. This is a goofy one. 
Maybe in a few days i make it somewhat presentable, idk.
